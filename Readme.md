#Simplex

Is a language with very simple syntax, you can only declare
variables of type integer or string. Also you can assign a 
value or not.


Syntax sample:

::

    program {   
        str foo;
        str bar = "Hello";
        int baz = 42;
        int boo = -23;
    }


You can use the sample files on test folder.


The main idea of this project is develop this simple language 
using the lexer and parser tools of several programming 
languages.
